# Imposter Game

A social deduction web game built with ASP.NET Core MVC where players try to identify the imposter among them!

## Game Overview

**Imposter Game** is inspired by popular social deduction games. Players are assigned secret identities from a chosen topic (Football Players, Jobs, or Countries), except for one player - the imposter - who doesn't know which identity they're supposed to have. Through discussion and questions, players must work together to identify who the imposter is!

## Features

- **Multiple Game Modes**
  - **Local Play**: Pass-and-play mode for groups playing on the same device
  - **Remote Play**: Online multiplayer with shareable game codes and links

- **Topic Selection**
  - Football Players
  - Jobs
  - Countries

- ** UI**
  - Newspaper-themed lobby design
  - Footballer trading card-style role reveals

  1. Create a lobby (local or remote)
  2. Add players (3+ required)

## Game Mechanics

### Roles
- **Crewmates**: Each crewmate is assigned a secret identity (e.g., "Cristiano Ronaldo", "Teacher", "France")
- **Imposter**: The imposter sees "ELIMINATE" instead of a specific identity

### Winning
- **Crewmates win** by correctly identifying the imposter through discussion
- **Imposter wins** by blending in and avoiding detection

### Topics
Each game uses one of three topics:
- **Football Players**: Famous soccer players from around the world
- **Jobs**: Common professions and occupations
- **Countries**: Countries from different continents
